# This package generates auto-incrementing barcodes where branch-specific prefixes are being used.
# For a library with 10-digit barcodes, and a prefix of T123, this should generate on a range of
# T123000000 and T123999999
#
# There are a couple of problems with treating barcodes as straight-numerics and just incrementing
# them.  The first, and most-obvious, is that barcodes need not be numeric, particularly in the prefix
# part!  The second, as noted in C4::Barcodes.pm, is that you might not actually be able to handle very
# large ints like that...
